# About

This project is for students that can't get Cloud SDK working on their computers. Instead of running this web app on 
GAE, you can run it on your computer without the Cloud SDK (just right-click on main.py and select Run or type
`python main.py` in the Terminal).

Also run `pip install requirements.txt` to install the necessary libraries (**important**: peewee library is added to handle SQLite).

Instead of Google Datastore, this project uses SQLite (in a very simple way).
